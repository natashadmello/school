1. Introduction:
   The Yatzy program simulates the classic dice game.  Each player gets three turns to roll five dice. The goal is to achieve
   the highest score by forming specific combinations.

2. Instructions:
   - Enter the number of players.There are few rules:
        + The input must be a number greater than 1.
        + There is an upper limit to setting the number of players: 10
   - Click "Edit Name" to modify the current player's name or use the default.
   - Click the "Roll" button to roll the dice.
   - The game starts with the first player. After rolling, choose to either continue rolling or lock specific dice values.
   - Player can either choose to continue their turn or pass to the next player by clicking on "Turn"
   - The game ends when all players have completed their turns or clicked "Quit." The player with the most points wins.
   - Click "Pause" to pause/resume the game.
   - Use "Lock" buttons to lock/unlock specific dice values after rolling.
   - The game tracks time elapsed and displays it on the UI
   - Click "Reset" to restart the game or "Close" to exit.

3.  The functions of the game:
        The game has covered the required functions:
            - Displays the game window and the faces of the rolled dices for the user.
            - User can set players through a designated input field in the UI.
            - Allows users to select a new roll or give the turn to the next player.

            - This is the documentation of the game.

        Additional functions:
            - Dices have been implemented with the png figures.
            - User can set the number of players in the user interface.
            - Can Edit Names.
            - Scoreboard displaying the points players have earned.
            - Background colour changes, when the game is over. And resetting sets it to original colour.
            - Pause Button

4.  Description of the implementation of the windows and dialogs of the game
        a. The game starts by prompting the user to enter the number of players using a QInputDialog. The window features a
           boolean pointer for user confirmation.
        b. After the number of players have been recorded, Mainwindow appears.
           In the Mainwindow, two QGroupBox elements serve distinct purposes. The first displays the points table,
           featuring categories like Yatzy and Four of a Kind. The second presents player information, including details
           about the current player and remaining trials. Dice images are visually represented using QPixmap and QLabel.
        c. QPushButtons enable key game actions such as rolling dice, locking/unlocking, taking turns, resetting,
           closing, and pausing, enhancing user interaction.
        d. Background colour changes to skyblue when the game ends or player quits. And QMessagebox will pop up displaying
           winner's name and the point.

5. Implemented a few changes in gameengine.cpp:
   - The roll function now returns a vector of integers representing the new points obtained from the dice roll.
     It also handles the case when there are no more rolls left and signals the end of the game.
   - The give_turn function now returns an integer (0 or 1) to indicate whether the game is still
     ongoing or has ended. This provides clarity on the function's outcome.
